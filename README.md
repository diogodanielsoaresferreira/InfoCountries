# InfoCountries

The project was presented in the Data & Knowledge Engineering (Universidade de Aveiro), 2017.

The main goal is to compare world countries based on several metrics, like child mortality rate, birth rate and others.
The application is made using semantic web standards, to ease the machine-to-machine interaction.
Technologies like SPARQL, GraphDB or RDFa were used.
